This software was first written by Vladislav Yakovlev and had no license,
for it has never been really published. Now, with Vlad's permission, his
software has been published under the GPLv3 (see COPYING). Originally,
non-free "numerical recipies" were used in some functions and therefore, in
order to publish this software under a free license, they had to be
rewritten. Now these functions refer to the GNU Scientific Library instead,
which makes it possible that this software is free.

The differences between Vlad's original code and the initial free version of
it are summarized in the "ACD_nr_to_gsl.patch" file.
