This software was first written by Vladislav Yakovlev and had no license, 
as it was never published. Now, with Vlad's permission, his software has 
been published under the GPLv3 (see COPYING). Originally, non-free 
"numerical recipies" were used in some functions and therefore, in order 
to publish this software under a free license, they had to be rewritten. 
Now they use the GNU Scientific Library, which makes it possible that 
this software is free.

The differences between Vlad's original code and the initial free 
version of it are summerized in the "ACD_nr_to_gsl.patch" file.
